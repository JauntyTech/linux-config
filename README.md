# Linux Configuration

Welcome! This repository contains guides for configuring a development machine running Linux Mint. 

If you aren't running Linux Mint and would like to setup a virtual machine to host it, start with [virtual machine setup](https://github.com/quantum-media-tech/linux-config/blob/master/VIRTUAL_MACHINE_SETUP.md).

If Linux Mint is already running on your computer or virtual machine, see [Linux configuration](https://github.com/quantum-media-tech/linux-config/blob/master/LINUX_CONFIGURATION.md).

If you are running a different Linux distribution that is not based on Ubuntu and would like to use it for development, you can refer to [Linux configuration](https://github.com/quantum-media-tech/linux-config/blob/master/LINUX_CONFIGURATION.md), but you will need to adapt the instructions to your distribution. 

Once your machine is configured, begin working on a project by following [project setup](https://github.com/quantum-media-tech/linux-config/blob/master/PROJECT_SETUP.md).
